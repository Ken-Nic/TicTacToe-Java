# Purpose
Mainly to get more hands on with making GUI's with java

## Tic Tac Toe with a twist
Just like regular Tic Tac Toe, the aim of the game is to be the first player to fill a row horizontally,vertically, or diagonally.

### The Twist?
Unlike your regular Tic Tac Toe, a player can override a square that their opponent occupies! With a click of the override button you can lose your friends just as fast as playing monopoly!
